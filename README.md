# AchievementInfo
This is an Elderscrolls Online addon. [See all details and the download @ESOUI](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info350-AchievementInfo.html#info).

## Why is this a public project?
In case I quit or pause playing TESO and cannot maintain this addon, feel free to contribute to keep this up to date and running.
I'll still be available here and be able to update the ESOUI page.

## How to contribute?
Github is a mirror. Please contribute at https://git.f-brinker.de/fbrinker/elderscrolls-addon-achievementInfo - You can login with your Github account (OAuth2).

Then, create a fork of the repository, do what you have to do and create a pull-request afterwards. Feel free to contact me any time.
